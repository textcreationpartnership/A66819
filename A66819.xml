            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107203:52"/>and proſper ye valient men, for God is with you.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They differ in reſpect of the ſeat of the combate,<note place="margin">2 In the ſeate.</note> the naturall combate is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Sometimes nothing but the diſtemper of the body, that is the ſeat of the conflict; a ſicke body doth occaſion a diſtempered and ſicke minde; is it not ſtrange to ſee, what ſtrange effects, that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of melancholy doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, what feares and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours have they felt at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as though they had beene ſcorched in the flames of hell, what joyes, and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they have made at another time, as though they had beene rapt up into the third heaven, what conflicts they have ſuppoſed they have paſſed through, yet all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the production of a diſtempered body deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with melancholy? Now
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107203:53"/>this differs from the true combate.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, they differ as much as the ſhadow and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one from another: that combate betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit is really true, but that is but imaginary, like as you ſee upon the ſtage, one is a King, another is a Judge, another a ſouldier, which when the action is over, they are no ſuch men; ſo is it in this caſe, all this combate is but a meere ſhew.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In a true combate there are ſome ſcarres, ſome thing that ſtickes to him after the battell, and ſome booty is carried away as a teſtimony of his valour, ſo a Chriſtian that hath got ſome ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemy, hee hath got ſome ſtrength againſt his luſts, as it was ſaid of the houſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>Davids</hi> houſe did increaſe, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107203:53"/>
                  <hi>Sauls</hi> decreaſe; ſo is it here, grace it gaines ſomething at every combate, now after the combate is over, the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly perſon is as he was, there is no alteration, if hee was prophane before, ſo hee is ſtill, or if hee was civill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is civill ſtill.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They differ in their cure, a diſtempered body is cured with phyſicke, good ayre and temperate diet, but who is hee that can cure a ſicke, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered ſoule, not all the Phyſitians in the world. Nay, let mee ſpeake a bold word; not all the Angels in heaven, are able by all their wiſdome to helpe a wounded ſpirit; it muſt be no leſſe than the blood of the Lamb of God, that takes away ſin, and heales a ſicke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed &amp; deſtempered ſoule.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Againe the ſeate of this warre is ſometimes among the paſſions,<note place="margin">Num. 13.32.</note> ſo as one ſtandeth in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107203:54"/>oppoſition to another, Nay as the ſpyes that went to view the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the land they went to ſearch was a land that did eate up the inhabitants of it, ſo it is with our luſts, one luſt is ſo predominant, that it eates up another as you have an example in <hi>Herod,</hi> who being ambitious, did favour <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 6. Euſeb. lib. 8. cap. 17.</note> becauſe hee look't at the applauſe of the people (for all held <hi>Iohn</hi> as a Prophet) yet ſuch was his luſt to <hi>Herodias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Libido po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias quam iracundia tenebat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium, &amp; paulo poſt dicit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, quod Chriſtiana continentia neque mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, neque pecunia expugnari poteſt.</note> that for her ſake, hee caſt him into priſon, and afterwards cut off his head. So it is ſayd of <hi>Maxontius,</hi> that as hee was cruell, ſo was he incontinent, and ſometime his luſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie prevailed againſt that of cruelty, as inſtance is given in a Chriſtian Virgin whom hee had attempted to have defiled, in which caſe, ſayth my Author, that his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107203:54"/>incontinencie got the victory of his fury; but now this warre is not a warre amongſt them, but againſt them all; as they that are Chriſts doe crucifie the fleſh with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts:<note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> and the truth is, that, when as a man doth ſuffer his luſt to rule, is as if a man ſhould ſuffer his feete to guide his head, or the handmaid to rule over the miſtreſſe; ſo is it in this caſe, for our paſſion ſhould be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by reaſon, and reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the ſpirit, and then things would goe in a right order, therefore our Apoſtle doth ſhew that the fleſh luſts againſt the ſpirit, not that the fleſh luſts againſt the fleſh, for though the luſts of the fleſh may be at diſcord one with another, it is but like that which was betweene <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> which albeit there was ſome contention
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107203:55"/>betweene them,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.12.</note> yet they both joyned together againſt Chriſt; ſo that howſoever it be, that one luſt may in ſome caſes overthrow another, yet they will all conſpire againſt Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="6">6 THe next thing wherein they differ in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict is in their weapons,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 4.</note> the weapons of our warfare are not carnall but ſpirituall, ſo that looke what difference, there is betweene a carnall and a ſpirituall man, ſo much difference is there betweene a carnall and ſpirituall weapon: if yee ſhould ſee men goe to warres, and inſtead of warlike munition one ſhould carry a ſhovell, and another a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocke, and others ſhould carry
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107203:61"/>inſtruments for the plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tillage of the ground, you would either ſuppoſe that the enemy were weake, and contemptible, or elſe account them but as fooles or madde men, that would undertake ſuch a buſineſſe, being ſo ill furniſhed for it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may we account them as fooliſh and unwiſe, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a ſpirituall warfare with carnall weapons, more eſpecially againſt ſo potent an enemy, but that you may the better underſtand the meaning of the Apoſtle; obſerve, firſt that carnall weapons will not ſerve your turne. Secondly, that ſpirituall weapons will prevaile, afore the former.</p>

               <p n="2">2 It is not a reſtraint from ſinne that will ſerve our turnes, ſuch a reſtraint may ariſe from good education, and living in good families, or out of the goodneſſe of naturall temper, which is not ſo prone to ruſh into vice, as others are; or for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accompliſhment of a mans owne ends of profit or credit: now all this keepes but a man from the outward acts of ſinne, yet he may be as bad or worſe within every day than others; as wee ſee ſome men that are forbidden to worke at their trades outwardly, yet will they worke harde at them within ſtill, ſo it is in this caſe,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107203:63"/>that though it be ſo, that hee may not without ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage ſuffer ſinne to breake out, yet doth he worke within, and follow the trade of ſinne there.

               <p n="2">2 Againe, when ſinne breakes out, it is the more violent after a reſtraint, as you ſee it was with <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> for all their faire pretences, that they made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of equity and piety, yet when they brake out, how foule was their ſinne: as it is with ſuch, as are caſt into

               <p n="2">2 Another impediment is, hardneſſe of heart, it is called an obſtinate heart,<note place="margin">Deut. 2.30.</note> becauſe it doth refuſe mercy:<note place="margin">Eſa 6.10.</note> a fat heart, becauſe it makes men inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their condition:<note place="margin">Zach. 7.12</note> a heart as hard as the adamant ſtone, becauſe it maketh men hate to be reformed.

               <p n="3">3 The next impediment that hindreth a man from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, is ſelfe-love, I doe not meane that love which is naturall, but that which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for no man ever hated his owne fleſh: but this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſinfull ſelfe-love; when a man ſhall love his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy above his ſoule, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more than his God, and ſhall be at more coſt, and take more paines for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a baſe luſt, than to enjoy Chriſt: now when the ſpirit comes, it makes us to renounce all,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.34.</note> and to follow Chriſt. To ſuffer the loſſe of our goods, and of our hopes,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107203:117"/>as it was ſaid of <hi>Bradford</hi> that for that he would not make one ſcratch with a pen,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.24.25.26.</note> he loſt all his hopes that hee might have had in this world; and ſo did <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſe to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to renounce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Court, and the treaſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that hee might not loſe the peace of his conſcience, nor diſhonour his God; nay it doth ſo make us our of love with our ſelves, that neither father, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor wife, nor children, nor our owne lives ſhall be deare unto us, provided wee may but finiſh our courſe with joy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now to the third thing wherein I ſhall be brieſe; namely, the ends why the ſpirit may be ſaid to aſſiſt us in this worke, and there are two reaſons of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For to ſhew mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107203:118"/>that we are not able to doe it of our ſelves, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall agent cannot doe a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worke; <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an uncleane?

               <p>Thence is that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">Jer. 10.23.</note> I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe; it is not in man that walketh, to direct his ſteps: that is, we are too weake for any ſuch worke without Gods grace aſſiſting of us, and therefore we have good cauſe to bewaile our miſery, to lay aſide our pride, and confeſſe our poverty, and to ſeeke ſome other meanes of helpe and redreſſe at Gods hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſet out Gods power, this is his priviledge that hee onely is able to do this work;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107203:118"/>there are three wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by things came to have their being &amp; exiſtencie; by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Art, or Creation, the two former muſt have matter to worke upon, either <hi>in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi> as generation, or in <hi>actu,</hi> as Art, and where there is not a matter to worke upon they can doe nothing, now for as much as this worke of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> &amp; the new creature is called a creation, it is beyond the worke of a creature, and onely a priviledge that doth belong to the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to create in us qualities of holineſſe, and thereby to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the whole body of ſinne, thence it is that the Lord ſaith, I create the fruit of the lips to be peace,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.19</note> and the Prophet complaining in another place to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed, it is that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and potent arme of the Lord that doth this worke;

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:107203:127"/>when they found where his great ſtrength lay; it is eaſie for a man in generall, to ſay that he is a ſinner, and yet if you ſhould runne over the Commandements, and come to particulars, he would cleare himſelfe as not guilty of any, and ſay as the young man did, all theſe have I done; and like the Harlot,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.20 Prov. 3.20.</note> wipe her mouth, and ſay I have done no wickedneſſe; therefore your care muſt be to ſearch out wherin the great ſtrength of ſinne doth lye, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt labour to take the light of the word to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us, and deſire God that he will give us the light of his holy ſpirit to open our eyes, that we may bee able to ſee and know our owne ſinfull hearts; and when wee have found it, ſet upon this worke with courage and reſolution.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107203:127"/>that makes ſinne ſo hard to be mortified; as that marriage that is made betweene ſinne and us:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.4.</note> after the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had mixed themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, and made marriages with them; they were wonderfully hard to be brought to leave them;<note place="margin">Ezr. 10.</note> ſo when as a man is married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his luſts; ſo it is a hard thing for a man to leave them, but now for a man to kill his wife, this is much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. It was a hard matter to fleſh and bloud, for <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne, and yet at the commandement of God he did it; ſo muſt we doe, our obedience to God muſt exceed our love of our ſinnes; though the matter be difficult, yet it muſt be done; as <hi>Iephtah</hi> when he had made a vow unto God, though it turned afterward to his great griefe, ſo to part with his onely daughter; yet

               <p>I Have onely one motive to adde to perſwade you to mortifie ſinne, and that is the words of my text: if yee doe this, you ſhall live; life, as you have heard, is a large word, and doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie not onely the life natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but that of grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; now here I take it; for the life of glory, as ſtanding in oppoſition to the death, that is ſet over in the former part of the verſe, which is that eternall puniſhment in hell, which ſhall be certainly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107203:140"/>inflicted on unmortified men, that live after the fleſh, and this life that is ſet in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition thereunto, is that life, that certainly may be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by ſuch as doe mortifie the fleſh, and endeavour to deſtroy that body of ſinne, now this happineſſe that is here ſpoken of, if I had the tongue of men and Angels, yet could I not ſufficiently ſet it out, yet to give you a taſte of what is revealed, that you may gueſſe at what is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, but beleeved, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, ſome thing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There ſhall be a perfect victory over all your enemies, over ſinne that hath beene ſo turbulent; over death, that hath beene ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and over hell that is ſo dreadfull, ſo as now wee may boaſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55.</note> as he that putteth off the harneſſe, and triumphs,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107203:140"/>becauſe that his warfare is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and our ſinnes are pardoned:<note place="margin">Eſa 40.2.</note> here the Church triumphant, doth change their ſwords into Scepters, their corſlets into Crownes, and their garments rouled in blood, into long white robes to follow the Lambe whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth; now we may ſing with the Saints, the ſong of <hi>Moſes Haleluiah</hi> unto him that dwelleth in the higheſt, and to him that ſitteth on the throne for evermore.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There ſhall be a reſting from all our labours, from all our workes, either of body or of mind, ſo farre as they did conſiſt in our ſeeking, for the preſervation of our preſent beeing, or from the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our future well-being: here it is laid upon us, to eate bread in the ſweat of our faces: and to indure heat and cold, hunger,<note place="margin">Gen. 3, 19,</note> and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107203:141"/>but there ſhall be an end of all theſe, poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall reſt in the boſome of rich <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the bleſſed Saints ſhall ſit downe with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 8.12.</note> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Kingdome of God: here there is our worke of faith, and labour of love, our hope waiting for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and our teares of godly ſorrow unto repentance, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a bleeding, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart: but there our faith ſhall be turned into viſion,<note place="margin">Hebr. 4.9.</note> our love and hope, into fruition, and then all teares ſhall be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from our eyes, doubtleſſe ſuch a reſt there is for the people of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There ſhall be the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, that is, wee ſhall be brought into the preſence of God, and ſhall ſee God in Chriſt, the beames of the Deity ſhall be ſo reſplendent
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107203:141"/>from Chriſt his humanity, as that wee ſhall ſee him; as wee are ſeene; there fore our Saviour prayeth <hi>that where hee is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3.2. John 17.24.</note> 
                  <hi>there they may bee alſo,</hi> that they may behold his glory: a glimps of this there was in the transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, it is Good for us to be here, and in that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee ſaw things unutterable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhall ſee with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inlargements of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. No Eagles eye ſhall be ſo ſtrong that can looke on the Sun, as ours then that can looke upon him, at whoſe preſence the ſight of many ſins would vaniſh into darkneſſe. If <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of nature could underſtand ſo much of God, as to give names unto the creatures; ſure in the ſtate of glory, there will bee a great augmentation of that fight; ſo that he that was an
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107203:142"/>unlearned man, ſhall know that at once that many agreat Doctor have been many yeere bearing their heads about.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againe, in reſpect of the ſight, this ſight muſt be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the light of the Sunne is no more to be compered unto it, then the light of the Candle is in the light of it: no, nor as one obſerveth well, it is <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam unus maximus Sol,</hi> all the whole heaven, it is, as it were nothing but all glorious Sun.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, wee ſhall enjoy the fruition of God,<note place="margin">Rabeus.</note> 
                  <hi>quod ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatur in viſione perficitur in fruitione;</hi> that which is begun in the viſion of God, ſhall be perfected in the fruition of God: <hi>Dives</hi> ſaw <hi>Abraham</hi> a farre off, and <hi>Lazerus</hi> in his boſome; but what was this to <hi>Dives,</hi> it was no eaſe to him, but as we ſhall ſee him, ſo wee ſhall enjoy him; hee will love us with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107203:142"/>love, and we ſhall live with him for ever;<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.8.9.</note> nay wee ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fulneſſe of his houſe, and he ſhall make us drinke of the rivers of pleaſure, for at his right hand is fulneſſe of joy and pleaſure for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. <hi>vit.</hi>
                  </note> If a man had a certaine meaſure of joy in heaven, were it not full, it would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the minde of a man, and if he had fulneſſe, were it not perpetuall; it would not give content, but now ſeeing this joy is both perfect and perpetuall, there will bee full content in it.</p>
               <p>To conclude all, bleſſed and happy are all thoſe that have mortified this body of ſinne, out of an hatred and holy indignation againſt it, they are carefull to ſinne no more; for they ſhall live a life of grace here, and life of glory hereafter.</p>
